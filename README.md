# Learn Go with Tests

This repo contains Go programs written as part of my learning journey with Go, following the ["Learn Go with Tests"](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests) tutorial.

## Getting started

To run the programs, you need to install Go in your machine first.

### Running a program

Navigate to the directory of the program you want to run. For example:

```bash
cd hello-world
go run main.go
go test
```
